I am a swift responder bubble.

Give me a swift MT540, MT541, MT542 or MT543  

and I will respond with MT548 ack,  MT548 match, and either MT544, MT545, MT546, MT547.  

(call me as follows :  

return App.getSwiftResponse(input).get(typeresponse);

where input = the Swift MT String (including header and all)
and typeresponse = "ack", "match" or "settle".
the response is a String of the requested response.
